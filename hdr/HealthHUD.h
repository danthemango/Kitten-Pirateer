DrJ -- (Data) Encapsulation:

A header file in itself is a representation of data encapsulation. The variables and 
functions are instantiated but not defined, that is left up to the corresponding
cpp file to do. 
Others can use the public methods, but have no knowledge on how these functions are 
implemented and the only information that suggests the purpose of these functions
are the function names and the proper documentation paired along with the definition.

/*
DrJ -- Inheritance:

HealthHUD is derived from the HUD class to polymorhpically implement the abstract displayHUD
function. 
A subclass can access all the non-private and protected members of its superclass (base class).
HealthHUD does not modify HUD by extends the use of the function named above to be 
associated with the HealthHUD class. HealthHUD is-a HUD object.

The method within this class is bound to this class by the use of the  class operator "::".
