//DrJ Encapsulation
//Jukebox is a good example of encapsulation because only the relevant info
//is displayed to the interface users while how it is done is hidden.
//Definition: Prevents the data from unwanted access by binding of code and 
//data in a single unit called object. Implementation is hidden from the 
//outside world. Only method signature is outward-facing and is accessible 
//from outside. This is called object interface. This can be thought of as a 
//black box kind of device. Inside the black box is the mechanical code and 
//the data. We canâ€™t see how the black box does its job but we can access 
//the output through its interface. Thus the implementation is encapsulated 
//within this black box which is considered an object.
